SumByColor - A libre office calc macro that takes as input a range of cells and a reference cell. The function scans a range of cells to find ones that match the reference cell's background color. Each cell with a matching color then has its value extracted and added to a sum. Useful for color coded sheets. Example usage: =SUMBYCOLOR("C5:I50", "N28") where C5:I50 is the range of cells and N28 holds the reference color. 


RemoveWhitespace - Select cells that contain whitespace before or after the text that you want to keep. Run the macro to remove leading and trailing spaces.
